It is possible to show a list of users currently logged on to the talker, or
to finger a particular user from another application (commonly a www cgi
script).

[ Try: http://orchard.imaginary.com/cgi/who.cgi
       http://orchard.imaginary.com/cgi/finger.cgi?alcides ]

To do this, you will first have to compile the "rquery" utility.

To do this, edit the file util/Makefile and add rquery to the all: line; then
recompile.

There are some example cgi scripts in the "html" directory.

(I will get around to improving this documentation at some point.. )
