1.1.0
 - Fixed bug in the editor where listing a file containing a line longer than
   1024 characters would cause general memory corruption. Also added a check
   to sadd_strbuf() to pick up any similar problems.
 - Fixed bug in the epost command. exiting with an empty buffer or with the
   ~q command caused a crash.
 - Some more logging added - chgender is now notified to admin, eval too long
   events are logged to syslog.
 - The remote command can now use . feelings.
 - Changed the 'wait for jlms' pause code in shutdown.

1.1.1
 - Added alias functions: substr(), strlen(), environment(), room_name(),
   user_on().
 - Updated the man page for map() - it was wrong!
 - Added 'reecho' option in the editor (requested by Dreamer)
 - Added an extra reset_eval_depth() call.. Sometimes evaluation could be too
   long during a login (Rare event but spotted by Neil).

1.1.2
 - Fixed 'reecho' option in the editor.
 - Fixed crash bug in search-and-replace in the editor.

1.1.3 & 1.1.4
   Never properly released, interim version given to a couple of people.

1.1.5
 - Added the 'R' command to the mailer help page.
 - Changed the message given by 'start' a little.
 - Small security fix to erqd. It was possible for an overseer to mail himself
   any file on the machine (eg. /etc/passwd)... not so good if the overseer
   doesn't have account access.
 - Changed sudo to reset the user's level to that stored in mastersave rather
   than that stored in their user file - a bit extra security.
 - New command, 'as' - execute a command as a certain level - mainly for admin
   to test with.
 - Fixed the 'sudo' logging.
 - Deleting a user now also removes any pending valemail requests for them.
 - 'su' command now disregards any capitalisation of its argument.
 - 'jlm reload' now also implicitly does an 'erqd restart'
 - If you send a mail message to yourself using the 'M' command in the mailer
   and it fails (due to the erqd being absent), then it will tell you so
   instead of silently ignoring the message.
 - New jlm functions: move(), join().
   Fixed a crash bug in jlm::force();
 - Comments in datafiles can now begin with a ; character as well as a #
   character.
 - Internal restructure: have introduced generic 'tcp socket' objects. A
   user object now uses a tcpsock object for its network communications.
 - Service ports now use the new 'tcp socket' objects. They can now handle
   character mode telnet clients (*grin Dreamer*). Service ports now also
   have a 60 second timeout to conclude business.
 - Events system restructure - remove_event() on current_event caused an
   event lockup until the next add_event().
 - All tcpsocket objects now buffer their output (no more 'wrote x bytes,
   should have been y.' messages - although I don't think they ever happened.
 - Added a check to stop sockets hanging if they received more input than their
   buffer could cope with; in these extreme cases, the input received so far is
   just dumped. (This should never happen, example: a player would need to send
   2K of data without a newline in it)
 - The '-' character is now a shortcut for the 'to' command.
 - Lots of small network code changes.
 - Changed mkcmdprot programs to accept function names containing numbers.
 - Initial Intermud-III protocol support.
   (See http://www.imaginary.com/intermud/intermud3.html)
 - Netstat command now also includes UDP packet activity and shows service
   and i3_router ports.
 - Restructure of udp intermud code. It is now possible to have any combination
   of the intermud systems compiled in (yes, I tried all 8 combinations).
   (Previously, CDUDP was dependent on INETD and it wasn't possible to
    compile without any intermud)
 - While I was at it, fixed compiling without a service port!
   One day, going to have to try compiling with all combinations of options..
   Don't think I'll ever have the time though.
 - Syslog output is also written to console (if booting in console mode)
   This is subject to a define in config.h
 - Hash table changes. It is now possible to specify a hash function to use
   for each hash table rather than having to try and find a one which works
   satisfactorally for all tables. (Besides, the existing hash function was
   no good for imud3 hosts ;-)
 - A finger request sent via the service port now returns a mailto URL for
   the user's email address. (Suggested by Sweep I think...)
 - Global aliases are now dynamic and altered / viewed with the "galias"
   command.
 - Alias change.. The 'unalias' commands are gone. To remove an alias, use
   'alias <alias-to-remove>' .. similarly 'ralias', 'galias' and 'aliases'.
 - The 'edalias' commands are gone. To edit an alias, use
   'alias edit:<alias-to-edit>' .. similarly 'ralias' and 'galias'.
   (I suppose you could write 'edalias' as an alias ;-)
 - Another alias change.. $0 is now available and is the name of the command
   being run.
 - Banish is no longer case sensitive.
 - New command, 'chanblock' to block arbitrary intermud channels. The options
   have been removed from "earmuffs".. Due to this restructure, all users'
   earmuffs options have been reset.

1.1.6
 - If the connection to the intermud-III router fails, the talker will wait
   60 seconds and then attempt to reconnect.
   The talker now also notifies consul and above of the failure.
 - Added a missing FUN_END call which made the backtrace log useless.
 - Added some checks on the function stack.. If anything goes wrong, the
   talker will abort.

1.1.7
 - Fixed small I3 problem, if the router connection was down, it wasn't
   possible to use any of the intermud systems.
 - Rewrote the i3-router reconnect code. If the link fails, the talker will
   wait 60 seconds before retrying. If the link can't be brought up, then
   the talker will wait for 120 seconds before retrying. The delay doubles
   with each attempt. 
   If the link does come up and remains up for 10 minutes then this counter
   is reset to 60 seconds again.

1.1.8
 - It takes a long time to store the intermud-III database and the talker
   was hanging while the save took place. The database dump is now done by
   a child process, leaving the main talker to continue.
 - Doubled the size of the malloc table.

1.1.9
 - 'help CHANGES' and 'help CHANGES.all' now available to all levels.
 - The 'chlim' command is slightly less destructive in that it will no longer
   allow you to set a limit which will truncate existing aliases /
   mail messages.
 - Siteban host format changed.
 - Fixed bug in the hibernate code!
 - It is now possible to limit the ip addresses which you can log in from
   by adding them to a personal grupe. The grupe's name is defined at compile
   time but is '_valid_ip' in the distribution.
   See 'help siteban' for details of the host matching.
 - Fixed the i3 router connection handler. If the talker managed to establish
   a router connection which dropped immediately, then it would instantly
   retry - was causing it to to repeatedly try and establish connection.

1.1.10
 - Changed the crash trace routine.. it was causing some crash bugs to show
   up falsely as a crash trace stack overflow.
 - Fixed bug in the erqd email sending. Sending any email messages containing
   % characters caused the talker to die.
 - Having fixed that one, sending any email messages containing % characters
   caused erqd to die (similar bug)!

1.1.11
 - Incoming I3 channel-t support.
 - Tidied up channel-[em] support.
 - Stopped the duplicate hashing problem.
 - Changed the logic in dropped router connection handling (again!) I think
   it is right now..
 - Implemented remote channel who over intermud 3.
            (Use <channel> @<mud>)

1.1.12
 - The file etc/logout.newbie is shown to people who have logged in less
   than 20 times.
 - Changed the logic in dropped router connection handling (again!) See above
   comment.
 - Added trap to stop broadcasting channel who requests over inetd and cdudp
   (They are not implemented there)
 - Removed current_execution variable - duplicates work done by the function
   trace code.
 - Added more function tracing to intermud 3.
 - Rewrote parts of i3_update_host()
 - Removed the RUN_USER / RUN_GROUP config options.
 - Updated the config.h file.. collected groups of options more logically
   and changed some defaults.
 - Changed the maximum evaluation depth to 20 (was 10) as some complex aliases
   can achieve a depth of 10.
 - Removed the "ihistory" command.
 - Channel history is now available on all three intermud networks by
   broadcasting a ! message (same as built in channels).

1.1.13
 - User mailboxes are now stored to disk in an encrypted form.
 - New command, 'abbr'. Well, not exactly a command - it's a global alias
   which wraps the alias command. There is a help page.
 - It is now possible to leave the editor either by typing a . alone on a line
   or by typing ** alone on a line. This is for people who are used to muds
   which use this terminator.
 - The 'boot' command can now take an aditional argument which is the number
   of minutes to banish the user from the talker for. The default is still
   five minutes.
 - New command, 'from'.
 - You can now enter the mailer even if you have no mail.
 - If a crash occured at the wrong time, it was possible for a user's password
   to end up in the backtrace log; this should no longer happen.
 - Extra backtrace debugging added to the login routine. It should make it
   easier to pinpoint the elusive crash bug.
 - Improved the 'mailall' program a bit.

1.1.14
 - Fixed the 'f', 'r' and 'M' commands in the mailer to deal with encrypted
   messages. Fixed carbon copy encryption.
 - Three unsuccesful logins will now suggest that you send email to the
   administrators.
 - Alias file parsing now has improved error checking. Duplicate aliases will
   also be filtered out.
 - In order to keep a channel history on local channels, LOCAL_CHANHIST must
   be defined in the config file. Public (Intermud etc.) channels are not
   effected.
 - New editor command, ~R, will recall the last message you edited. Useful
   if mail you have sent fails for any reason (mistyped addressee ?) as you
   can quickly send it again.

1.1.15
 - Jlm communications now use buffered input. Should fix the problems with
   the calculator and the odd problem with the bio jlm.
   Also fixed a bug which made the talker crash if a jlm died (*oops*).
   Wrote a 'crash' jlm for testing.
 - Small speed increase in scan_tcpsock() function.
 - Restructure of find_user and with_user to report if a match failed or if
   there were multiple matches... (Suggested by Dreamer)
 - Added find_user_absolute() .. should save a few CPU cycles.
 - write_user() in the jlm library no longer expects a trailing newline
   character. Similarly, write_level() etc.
 - write_user_nonl() added to the jlm library for writing text without a
   trailing newline character.
 - The doom.jlm is now distributed as an example.

1.1.16
 - When a who listing is retrieved via the service port, it now contains
   html tags linking to the appropriate finger information for each user.
 - Fixed the 'assist' command.
 - Added ambiguous username reporting to soul commands.
   It is also now possible to specify multiple recipients of soul commands
   separating them by commas.. This may need tidying up, let me know if it
   works ok! It should also be possible to use feelings with a Grupe as the
   target.. again, let me know!
 - Added new composite_words() string functions to handle construction of
   'a, b, c and d' type lists.
 - Extended expand_user_list() function.
 - The number of notes on a board and the position of the last note are now
   cached. This speeds up lots of things, from the 'look' command where the
   number of notes on the board is reported, to loading a board from disk
   as the last note position no longer has to be calculated for each note
   loaded.
   This also speeds up an mbs check on a board with no unread messages as
   only the last note needs to be compared against.

1.1.17
 - Added sticky notes. (See 'help sticky')
 - New option to the 'write' command which supresses the trailing newline.
   ( -n )
 - Basic colour support started. parse_colour() function added which can
   cope with all colours, on receipt of an instruction string. This is
   currently only called from parse_cookie() which allows users to
   colour their prompts using cookies. It is also called from JLMs allowing
   a JLM to select any colour.
   It is possible to add triggers using aliases so that colour is used..
	Example:  alias say write -n \%c~\%c!r;\\say $*;write -n \%cz
   This support is termcap based, and there have been significant changes to
   the termcap code.
 - The yellow() function is now just a wrapper to parse_colour(, "!y")
 - 'fixscreen' command extended to reset colour codes too.
 - Small change to comments in alias. If you had a comment character (#) 
   anywhere in the alias, then it would return with 'command not found'
   or equivalent.
 - Fixed bug in the socket code introduced in 1.1.15. It was not possible to
   paste text into the telnet client window... lines and characters were
   being mislaid - I don't think anyone noticed ;-)

1.1.18
 - New option to the 'chemail' command. It is possible to blank out a user's
   email address completely and still allow that user to save to disk.
   (This was added so that I could blank out Wellard and Sharpe's address
    as they seem to no longer have net access but have been around since the
    talker started and so will not be deleted!)
   Syntax is 'chemail -r <user>'
 - Added a confirmation message to the 'sticky' command.
 - Changed the 'time on this session' message at logout.
 - Fixed the append_file() function.

1.1.19
 - Fixed a bug in expand_alias. Block was falling through instead of returning.
   (This caused any alias which used a \\ expansion override to crash the
    talker)
 - Tightened up the jlm handling. When the talker crashes with a fatal error,
   it now shuts down any jlms before it dumps core.
 - Changed the dead_jlm handler to use waitpid() or wait3() instead of wait().
   If more than one jlm exited or crashed at the same time, then the talker
   would only spot one of them and would detect an error (flushed output)
   every time it went around the main loop from then on.
   This also happened if more than one jlm was missing at boot time.
 - Changed the banner jlm. If its parent disappears (the talker) then it will
   now exit cleanly of its own accord. If it does somehow drop into a loop,
   it pauses for one second each time around and so should not consume too
   much CPU.
 - Changed the jlm library slightly. It sleeps for one second per read_line()
   call - This should not affect performance.
 - Added general support functions for the mapping datatype (previously used
   only by the intermud-III system)
 - New command, 'attr' will be used for setting various colour attributes
   (These are stored in a mapping in the user's savefile).
   At the moment, there are only two attributes available.

1.1.20
 - Various misc changes.. _Entry room as the entrance is no longer hard coded
   into finger_text(). Running make in a subdirectory now tells you that you
   should be running it from the top level. mkspod script now works if there
   are no users with time on of more than a day.
 - 'out' is now a visitor command.
 - Previously, if you used a bad range in the editor (such as 2-1) then you
   would not be told about it until after you had saved the text.
 - Intermud channel attributes have been split into three different channel
   types.
 - New attributes for notification and incoming personal messages.
 - 'attr default' sets up some defaults for your colour attributes.
 - The 'ansi' command is now called 'termtype'
 - Added a help page for 'colour' and 'color'.
 - The yellow() function is gone.

1.1.21
 - If someone sends you mail and it fails because your mailbox is full, you
   now get a sticky note telling you this.
 - A couple of misc fixes and changes.
 - New users are now asked at login what colour level they want. This sets
   up some or all of their colour attributes to the defaults, also prompts
   for their terminal type.
 - Backtrace log messages are now time stamped.
 - Compiling in memory debug mode now prints a message to that effect before
   it starts... (*grin Dreamer*)
 - New command, 'alconf' allows you to load a default set of aliases. The
   aliases are held in the etc/ directory in a file called aliases.<profile>
   The only supplied profile is ew2
 - Restructure of login code.

1.1.22
 - The version number of the running talker is now stored in a user file
   when it is saved. Allows for setup of new features as they are introduced.
 - If any user has not logged in to a version > 1.1.21, they will be asked to
   select their initial colour level.
 - New colour attributes. room*, shout.

1.1.23
 - Fixed crash bug in the channel-e packet parser.
 - Fixed typo in 'Unknown or ambiguous host name' message.
 - If SECURE_PASSWORDS is not defined, passwords must now still be at least
   four characters.
 - New command, 'import' allows you to import your aliases and colour
   attributes from another JeamLand talker. The remote talker does not send
   any passwords over the link in encrypted or unencrypted form. The local
   talker does not allow arbitrary incoming import data.
   See 'help import.tech' for more details.   (Dreamer's idea)
 - CAN_SEE macro now takes account of users who are in the same room.
 - count_users() with no subject uses cached number of users value.
   count_users() now uses CAN_SEE.
 - You can now select how you want to build cmd.table.h from the Configure
   script. If you don't have lex, you can choose awk. If you don't have awk,
   then you can choose sed, which will work, but should really be a last
   resort.
 - 'alias debug' is now 'alias -debug'
   To remove all aliases at once, use 'alias -wipe'
 - To reset all colour attributes to default, use 'attr -default'
   To remove all colour attributes at once, use 'attr -wipe'

1.1.24
 - Increased the maximum prompt length. (Who would believe that anyone could
   have a prompt of more than 40 characters ?!)
 - Fixed another crash bug in the channel-e parser - Hopefully the last.
 - New command, 'showtail'.
 - Continued to change the word options of commands to start with a -
   character. Updated hosts, ghosts, jlhosts, feelings.
 - Added new colour attributes for local channels, removed "localchan", added
   "lc-<channel name>"
 - The 'attr' command now checks the user's attribute list, removing unknown
   or out-of-range attributes.
 - 'import' now also transfers the user's prompt.
 - Complete restructure of intermud protocol selection. Common commands
   (tell, finger and who) have been pulled out into a new src file, imud.c
   and they all use a common request_route() function. Hopefully, fallback
   routes will work now.
 - As a consequence, the method by which a protocol can be forced has changed.
   If you want to force a tell, who or finger request to use a particular
   network, then prefix the host name with ^i for inetd, ^3 for imud3 and
   ^c for cdudp.
 - On boot, the talker will now also ping itself, regardless of whether it
   is in its own inetd_hosts file. This ensures that a talker is in its own
   jlhosts list.
 - It is now possible to compile a new version even if the talker is running
   and the binary is still present.
   
1.1.25
 - Rewrote part of the hosts/ghosts/jlhosts command. Hopefully fixed the
   problem whereby the last host wasn't listed if it was alone on the last
   line.
 - Added new member_grupe() function, rewrote member_sysgrupe() to use it.
 - Preferred grupe support. If you have a grupe called _preferred, then if
   a search for a user is ambiguous and returns multiple matches, then if
   one of the people matched is in your _preferred list, then that user
   is selected. See the end of 'help grupe' for more information!
	(Suggested by ElDavid)
 - Fixed linewrapping with a coloured prompt.
 - It is now possible to set attributes for messages received in a room
   from a particular user. See 'help attr' for more info.
	(Suggested by Dreamer)

1.1.26
 - Rewrote boot command. To specify a banish delay, you now use an initial
   -t flag.	(Spotted by Gamma)
 - Incoming intermud tells may now use partial usernames - all protocols.
 - interjl(admin) channel messages now have packet timeout and retransmission.
 - Added support for clients which use IAC GA to define their prompts.
   This, along with the previous 'tush' command is toggled by an argument to
   the 'prompt' command - See the help page. (Suggested by Winzlo)
 - 'prompt' with no arguments no longer resets your prompt to the default
   but rather shows your current settings. Use 'prompt -default' for the old
   behaviour.
 - Added a 'cpuser' command	(Suggested by ElDavid)
 - Fixed 'delete_user' to also remove the mailbox.
 - It was possible (although extremely unlikely) that while a jlm was being
   processed, it could have been removed from memory by the dead_child
   signal handler, so causing a crash. (This happened to The Orchard..)
 - Changes to the colour parser. It is now possible to specify any foreground
   colour together with any background. In an 'attr', you can just tag the
   options together (Example: !~Mg  - Bold, blinking, green on magenta)
   In prompts, you must use separate %c cookies
   (Same example: %c!~M%cg)

1.1.27
 - Added support for the remote notification client (see the new rnclient/
   directory).		(This one suggested by Santa)
 - Fixed colour reset codes in termcap.
 - Small changes to network code.
 - Removed the two sleep() calls in erqd.c
 - Added a generic UDP socket datatype which is used by the intermud systems
   and rnclient.

1.1.28
 - Hopefully fixed a bug in the prompt handling code.
 - It is no longer possible to have both IACGA and IACEOR prompt options set
   simultaneously.
 - Several changes to the erqd code. Changed some parts to be more RFC 1413
   compliant.

1.1.29
 - Another attempt at repairing colour support.
 - Fixed small (*cough*) security hole.. If a user had access to any command
   via sudo, then that user could execute arbitrary commands.

1.1.30
 - Unecessary colour reset codes are no longer sent.
 - Colour cookies now require a full-stop (.) as a terminator.
   Eg: before:   %cWr
       now:      %cWr.
   Terminator is optional for %cd or %cz
 - New colour cookie modifier, @ == normal.
   Eg: write %c!r.Bright red %c@.normal red %cz
 - Changed colour reset code for vt100 and xterm terminals.
 - New terminal type, broken_colvt100 for those vt100 emulators which don't
   recognise a full reset when they see one. JL will send colour codes for
   white on black, no attributes.
 - Added TELOPT_SGA processing to the telnet codes parser. Fixed bug relating
   to TELOPT_EOR parsing.   See RFCs: 858 & 885
 - New command, 'gwho' - suggested by ElDavid.
 - Added Solaris and Irix extra libraries to the rnclient Makefile.
 - Wrote a new help page 'intermud' which gives an overview of the three
   intermud systems used by JeamLand. It will hopefully clear up people's
   misunderstandings.
 - rnclient should now compile under Solaris.
 - If you type a line into the editor which exceeds your screenwidth, the
   editor will now insert line breaks at appropriate points.
 - Added some function traces to i3_update_host() and subsids to try and track
   the crash bug in there.

1.1.31
 - Fixed login problem where users could possibly end up stuck in the void.
 - 'help intermud' is now 'help intermud_sys'

1.1.32
 - Made CHANGES and CHANGES.all available for the 'sendme' command. 
   Usage of this command is now logged.
 - New version of rnclient, 1.2. Brief details of the protocol specification
   are included in the distribution (rnspec)
 - rnclient can now keep an eye on several talkers at once.
 - 'make rn' will now create the file lib/help/sendme/rnclient for people
   to email to themselves.
 - Increased the number of simultaneous rnclient connections to 20.
 - Rnclient now ensures that it only accepts packets from the host on which
   the talker runs. Previously it would have believed any incoming packet
   was from the talker.

1.1.33
 - Rnclient protocol upgraded to 1.3. New status of 3 for already logged in
   user.
 - Earmuffs option for rnclient messages.

1.1.34
 - Fixed the 'E' flag processing - if a user sets an email address then the
   flag is now removed.
 - Fixed rnotify - whenever a new client connected, initialisation messages
   were being sent to all current clients.
 - Editor linewrap - now wraps at 70 characters.
 - Rnotify pings can now have a status of 2 which is for a resync request.
 - Rntab command can now be used by admin to send messages to rnclients.
 - On startup, rnclient will now be told which connection it has acquired.

1.1.35
 - More fixes to RNClient resync.

1.1.36
 - Users can now choose whether they want auto linewrap in the editor.
   (This defaults to on, to turn it off you need to type '~o noautowrap'
   while inside the editor.)
 - Amended service port code to make proper use of the blocking tcpsocks.
   If a large who listing is to be written, for example, none of it will
   now be lost.
 - Erqd will now make two attempts at resolving each ip number/name -
   currently 3 seconds apart.
 - If the I3-router connection is dodgy, the repeated lost connections /
   reconnects will no longer be logged in syslog.
 - No user at any host may have more than two concurrent Rnclient sessions.
 - No rnclient may now send pings more frequently than once / two minutes.
   If a[n] rnclient does, it will be shut down.
 - Unix Rnclient changes (now version 1.4)
   - If a ping doesn't get through (i.e. an error is returned by the
     UDP sub-system) then that talker is removed from the rnclient's list.
   - Format of incoming talker messages changed.
   - Removed absolute value of 4 for sizeof(unsigned long) !
   - Protocol version is now 14 (see rnspec for more details - 'sendme rnspec')
 - Fixed the IACGA saveflag!.. It was sharing a bit with the NOEMAIL flag
   and so tending not to stay set.
 - Upgraded the rnclient protocol version to 0x14.
   If a client connects using protocol 0x13, it will work fine *grin Dreamer*.
   0x14 adds an extra field to all packets leaving the talker and sends each
   outgoing packet three times, at five second intervals.
   A client using protocol 0x14 will probably never miss out on a packet and
   will often receive a packet more than once.
   Status messages are now strings and not integers. 0 becomes -login,
   1 becomes +login etc. See protocol description for more info.
 - the 'rntab' command now triggers a rnclient connection cleanup - purging
   those clients which have timed out. The only other time this happens is
   when a user logs in or out.
 - If a client cannot connect due to the rnclient table being full, the
   connected rnclient list will be scanned for expired entries which may be
   removed before rejecting the connection.
 - Changed inetd to use unsigned long type packet ids.. Previously used
   just int which would have caused something interesting to happen after
   a while (when the int overflowed).
 - Took an unecessary one-second sleep out of the shutdown routine.
 - rntab arguments are now only useable by an overseer.
 - Fixed bug whereby a resident using sudo would suddenly become a visitor.
   (Spotted by Sweep).
 - Broken_colvt100 termtype is now slightly more insistant on performing
   a full reset. (Hopefully will fix Pandroid's background problems)
 - You can now set up a user attribute to be used as the default.
   (attr -user -default <col>)   - For Pandroid.

1.1.37
 - Fixed imud3 debugging - debug log on Orchard was being filled up.
 - New earmuffs option - i3_notify.
 - Fixed crash bug in the v.13 RnClient handler.

1.1.38
 - Rnclient packet retransmit is now 3 seconds and not 5.
 - Removed a surplus memcpy() call from erqd.
 - New rnclient user packet: "+startupafk"
 - Various small changes to the rnclient server.
 - Doing a 'rntab <client> die' now also removes the client from the current
   list of connections.
 - Unix rnclient upgraded to version 1.5

1.1.39
 - Made user colour attributes more consistent. emote was not making use of
   these attrs although memote was (!). Also, if a user set a colour for
   him/herself, then it would only show up for feelings.
 - Restructured user logout/lost connection notification. All of these now
   use a common function - no matter what causes a user to disconnect, the
   rnclients will be notified (previously, many of these were missed - boot,
   idle out ...)
 - mail line limit increased to 1000 in all places - there were places where
   it was still set to 50! - Added a global define.
 - New command, 'sig' for handling user .signatures.
 - RNClient version number changed to 1.42 - all versions of the RNClient
   which support protocol 1.4 will have version number 1.4x .. etc.
 - Cron emulation support added. JeamLand can be configured to run certain
   system commands at certain times. See doc/cron for more info.
 - Started to implement timezone support. Users can specify an adjustment
   in hours and half hours to be made to the talker's clock.
   So far, this is supported by:
	The %t cookie.
	'finger', 'date', 'events', 'last', '[jl|c]hosts', 'ls', 'valemail -p'
	Board and mail messages.
   If I have missed anywhere, please let me know.
   Command for this is 'tzadjust'

1.1.40
 - Small changes to the rnserver.
 - Rnclient now version 1.43 and supports a .rc file.

1.1.41
 - Rnclient protocol is now version 15.
 - Unix RNclient now at version 1.50
 - Rnclient has a new command line option. If it is started with a -c flag,
   then it will not start up if there is already an RNClient running as this
   user. 		(Requested by PAndroid)
 - Fixed small bug in backend.c. If the talker could not exec to set
   its proctitle then a fatal error would result.
 - Fixed bug in stack handling where a long integer could be truncated to a
   normal integer.
 - Added new stack type, UNUMBER - an unsigned long integer.
 - Rewrote siteban code from scratch. It is now much more flexible using
   ip numbers and netmasks to filter allowed sites.

1.1.42
 - Fixed user colour attributes for the 'to' command.
 - Changes to grupe parsing. The order of grupe elements, specifically grupe
   exclusions, is no longer important - as a result, grupes can now be
   sorted alphabetically, and are. The algorithm is much improved. When
   scanning your personal grupes if, after however many levels of recursion,
   the grupe is not found, then scanning will switch to the system grupes.
 - User colour attributes can now be set to grupes. Example:
	attr -user #overseer ~m

1.1.43
 - The 'siteban' command will now internally translate wildcard ip numbers.
	(example: siteban 123.124.*.* will now work)

1.1.44
 - Signature will now be appended when following up a board note.

1.1.45
 - Fixed bug in scan_tcpsock whereby some character mode clients could
   not backspace.
 - Some clients automatically send a SGA request at startup. JL would then
   display a message to the user such as "IAC GA rejected by client" which
   should not be shown unless that user has selected "prompt -iacga".
 - New command 'cron' if the talker is compiled with JL_CRON defined.

1.1.46
 - Added new alias functions *() and /().

1.1.47
 - Speedups in the tcp socket handling with a character mode client.
 - "jlm reload" is now "jlm -reload" to fit in with other commands.
   Similarly, "jlm add" is "jlm -add" and "jlm remove " is "jlm -remove"
 - JLMs can now be attached to three types of places.
	Rooms	As before, a jlm in a room is accessible to all users in
		that room.
	Users	The jlm is only accessible to that user.
		(No support for remembering about jlms after a user logs off)
	Global	A global jlm is accessible from throughout the talker.
		(For convenience, global jlms are stored in the Dummy user -
		 the messages may confuse. )
   The syntax of 'jlm' command has changed slightly (the existing syntax was
   not very good anyway)
 - Fixed jlm library bug which was causing jlms to respond slowly.
 - 'commands' command now shows and commands added by jlms.
 - Jlm commands will now be picked up by the 'which' command.

1.1.48
 - rnclient is no longer distributed as part of JeamLand.
 - Fixed 'commands' command - was missing off the last section.
 - Fixed crash bug in single user mode shutdown.
 - Changed messages in Makefile - changed "make sgi" to "make irix"
   and "make solariscc" to "make solcc".
 - Rnotify server no longer supports protocol version 13.
 - An RNClient which is sending startup pings too frequently will now be sent
   a "die" packet. (UnixJLRN no longer does this ;-)

1.1.49
 - jlm command messages now also go to consuls.
 - Intermud channels now support . prefixed feelings.

1.1.50
 - Added a 'freebsd' argument to the Makefile.
 - Changed object type macros to avoid an incompatibility with FreeBSD header
   files.
 - Fixed FreeBSD crypt incompatibility.
 - Added support to interpret a ^U character from a character mode client
   as "erase to start of line".
 - Users can now type "who" at the login prompt to get a who listing.
 - New option to mbs.... "mbs -R" is reply-to-sender-by-email.
 - New option to followup... "followup -e" is reply-to-sender-by-email.
					(Suggested by Dreamer)

1.1.51
 - 'attr' command now shows a sample of the selected colours when listing
   attributes.		(Suggested by Winzlo)
 - Fixed a bug in the editor with the ~r command. It wasn't removing the
   associated dead_ed file.
 - Added support to interpret a ^D character as a logout request.
 - Continued modifications to enable compilation on FreeBSD.
 - Some fixes to eliminate warnings when compiling on Solaris with cc
   ( make solcc ).
 - Changes to the 'banish' code - contents of the etc/banish file is shown
   to banished logins.

1.1.52
 - The conditions of use are now passed through the pager.
 - After accepting the conditions, if the file etc/newuser exists, the
   contents will be displayed to the new user.
 - Added configuration option REQUIRE_REGISTRATION. If this is defined, then
   new users can only log on as 'guest' (they will be allocated a guest number
   and currently it is possible to have up to 100 guests on at once) and will
   also be automatically supersnooped (if SUPER_SNOOP is defined).
   If a new user attempts to log on as anything else, then they will be
   shown the contents of etc/unreg.
   In addition, this removes the 'validate' command.
 - More fixes for FreeBSD.
 - Siteban command has a new -v option which will show full information for
   that ban rule, including the message shown to attempted logins.
 - Added support to enable JeamLand to grab a set number of file
   descriptors at boot time. Currently only tested on Linux.
 - Change to the COPYRIGHT under which JeamLand is distributed. This version
   of JL (1.1.x) may not be used for commercial purposes without explicit
   prior permission.
 - do_backups script rewritten. New options, -logs, -snoops, -q and -nomail.
 - The who command now accepts a list of users and grupes as an argument.
   eg:	who -a #warden+,!root,guest1
 - Fixed error in the makefile rule for cmd.table.h generation using sed.

1.1.53
 - Small fix to remove a warning on solaris with cc.
 - Board commands changed so that options are prefixed with a -.
 - Changed the 'board -reload' command to actually do something useful..
 - Added protection to the 'board -limit' command to avoid clobbering
   existing messages.
 - New board option. 'board -followup' can be used to redirect followup
   messages to another board. (Suggested by Dreamer)
 - 'objects' command now shows object creation times.
 - 'netstat' command now shows time of connection for each socket.
 - 'finger' output will now also show where mail is forwarded to, if it
   is forwarded.
 - A range (used in the editor and mailer) can now be open-ended at both ends.
   i.e., previously it would accept 1-5 and 1- but not -5 or just -. These
   last two are now supported.

1.1.54
 - Fixed the intermud who command.
 - If a user creates a room and then does nothing with it, it is not saved to
   disk.
 - New config option, NEWBIE_TUNEOUT. If set, new users will be tuned out of
   the intermud channels by default.
 - Moved some of the intermud channels around.. intermud and intercode are
   now resident level.
 - More FreeBSD fixes (valid_email enumeration).
 - Changed the 'gwho' command to 'swho' for 'Short-who'
 - Changed the format of the 'last' log file.
 - Removed the confusing messages concerning jlms inside the DUMMY user.
   They are still stored there, but this is no longer displayed in any log or
   notify messages.
 - Major restructure of jlms. An attached jlm now talks to the talker via a
   unix domain socket. The main advantage of this is that each jlm now only
   uses one file descriptor (previously it was two) - freeing up more fd's for
   other things (e.g. users!). Some unix systems may have problems with this,
   Linux-1.2.x in particular has a hard limit in the kernel of 128 unix
   domain sockets in total. This means that assuming no other running
   processes were using any unix domain sockets, you could have a maximum of
   only 64 jlms attached. (64 sockets needed in the talker, one in each jlm).
   For this reason, if the talker can not obtain a unix domain socket,
   it will fall back to using two uni-directional pipes as before.
   [ Out of interest, tested JL with 200 jlms attached.. no problems,
     no obvious reduction in talker speed ]
   If this new behaviour is not wanted, or does not work properly, it can be
   turned off by defining BROKEN_SOCKETPAIR in config.h
 - Configure script changes, added help text. Changes to trap errors and
   hopefully work on more different systems.

1.1.55
 - Changed the exit(-1) calls to exit(1) in the utilities.
 - FreeBSD fixes, seems to work fine now although the meminfo command gives
   very limited information.
 - Changes to process_sockets(), combined user processing into one loop which
   should speed up user socket processing by a factor of three.
 - Backtrace markers added to socket code to track crash bug.
 - Changes to Configure - hopefully will work fine under IRIX now.

1.1.56
 - Fixed a bug in 1.1.55 which caused compilation to fail!

1.1.57
 - Moved attributes for intermud channels to resident level (in line with
   the channels)
 - Chanblock now only allows users to block channels which they can receive.
 - Added more debug lines to i3 hashing - there is something wrong in there.
 - Fixed the colour code routine. If a user set no terminal type and was then
   shown a coloured message, the . cookie terminators would still be shown.
 - Fixed problems which prevented compiling without all three intermud systems.
   It is now possible to compile with no intermud support, support for any one
   protocol, support for any two protocols or with total support.

1.1.58
 - termcap changes - full reset codes added. 'fixscreen' will now do a full
   terminal reset. The 'termcap' command now also displays a description of
   each terminal type.
 - A visitor selecting 'full colour' at login, will now get any resident
   attributes added too.
 - Small changes to socket code following a (puzzling) crash on Future.
 - Removed the 'sudo' variable from user, replaced it with a runtime flag.
   NB: This means a full recompile is necessary as the size of struct user has
       changed!
 - Fixed 'myrooms' command to handle rooms with a . in the filename.
 - Changes to the jlm library - fixed small memory leak (which most likely
   never manifested itself) and reduced the size of some static buffers.

1.1.59
 - It is now possible to display selected parts of the output of 'date' by
   passing arguments to the command (see the help page).
 - 'remote' is now just a special case of 'tell'. This means that you can
   remote to several users/groups etc. at once and that you can reply to
   a remote. The syntax for 'reply' is now:
	reply message		Reply as a tell
	reply :message		Reply as a remote
	reply .feeling		Reply with a feeling [ Suggested by Dreamer ]
 - If sending mail to a user who didn't have a current mailbox, the mail
   would not be encrypted straight away - fixed.     [ Noticed by Sweep ]
 - When replying to a message, the subject was set to 'Re: <old subj>'
   and if the message was again replied to, the subject was left unchanged.
   Now, the first message will be, as before, titled 'Re: <old subj>' and
   subsequent messages will be titled 'Re[2]: <old subj>' etc.
   e.g.:   1: This is a test              (JBloggs     Mon Jul 28 13:52)
	   2: Re: This is a test          (JSmith      Mon Jul 28 13:52)
	   3: Re[2]: This is a test       (JBloggs     Mon Jul 28 13:52)
	   4: Re[3]: This is a test       (JSmith      Mon Jul 28 13:52)

1.1.60
 Don't know what happened to this one...

1.1.61
 - The sudoers file structure has undergone a fairly major change although,
   almost unbelievably, it is backwards compatible in all regards but one;
   while it used to be possible to specify more than one line per user,
   this will now cause an error.
   See the supplied 'sudoers' file for example entries.
 - The 'sudo' command alone will now list the accesses which you have.
 - The 'attr' command no longer puts the 'sample' text quite as near the
   right margin - was causing problems with Winzlo's client! (5 spaces less)
 - Added multiple start room support. The system searches at boot time for
   rooms which start with the text in the ENTRANCE_PREFIX define. E.g. if you
   have two rooms _Entry and _Entry2 and ENTRANCE_PREFIX is defined as _Entry
   then these two rooms will be used as entrances.
   The method in which users are allocated to rooms is defined in config.h,
   the default is to use a room until it has 20 people in it then use another;
   where all rooms have more than 20 users, then the one with the lowest number
   will be selected.
 - To speed up the above, every internal object now maintains a count of the
   number of items in its inventory.. This does cause a slight anomoly where
   an entrance room contains jlms, as these count towards the 20 user limit -
   however, as the the aim is to balance load anyway, this is a good thing.
 - New argument to the 'rooms' command. Using 'rooms -reload' will cause the
   list of entrance rooms to be updated.
 - Added a config option to cause the talker to automatically engage
   'afk' if a user is idle for a set amount of time. This is set to 30 minutes
   in the distribution.
 - Added more signal explanations to the why-did-my-jlm-crash code.
 - Fixed colour bug - even with 'termtype off', some colours would still get
   through!  		[ Spotted by Dreamer on Future ]
 - Changed several user struct variables to type 'unsigned int'

1.1.62
 - Dropped 'intermud' and 'intercode' to resident level - they could see the
   channels but not talk on them.
 - Moved 'ilocate' to resident level.
 - Fixed indentation with 'sudo'.
 - Some hosts on intermud 3 have started up with names which appear to be
   non printable binary (?). The intermud 3 system will now just ignore
   any packets referencing these hosts. [ Spotted by Winzlo ]
 - Fixed bug in alias expansion where an element of a multi-command alias
   was a 'sudo' command (during which aliases are inhibited). Everything
   following the 'sudo' was being ignored.
 - Rewrote the service port code. Originally the service port was a
   one-command, one-response entity and could not support multiple line
   service requests. This restriction is no longer present and, in addition,
   the code is a lot more flexible now.
 - Added an 'email' service to the service port for external programs to use
   to deliver email to a talker user.
 - Rewrote 'rquery' to support multiple line service requests. Rquery can
   now also take its input from a file.
 - The release date of the talker version is now shown via the 'version'
   command, and at login.
 - Fixed the 'autoafk' feature. Previously, it was something of a mystery
   as to how long a user needed to be idle until it was engaged.
 - New 'mailbug' script. If the talker crashes, then the administrator need
   only type 'scripts/mailbug' to send the relevant logs to me.

1.1.63
 - Added new command 'next', which shows the next message on a board in the
   current room. A user can repeatedly use 'next' to read the entire board.
 - Updated mkspod script a little.
 - Added a couple of new alias examples to the end of alias.tutorial
 - Fixed a bug in the new debug part of write_tcpsock().
 - Fixed bug in the mailbug script.

1.1.64
 - Added cyclic log checking to the angel (UPRECORD log file).
 - Configure script changes. Better 'space' checking.
 - Added new command, 'grep' for searching files for substrings.
 - Changed a debug message in process_tcpsock to log in 'error' instead of
   'syslog' and also to produce a backtrace when it happens. Should help me
   find out why this is happening.
 - The msg/ directory is no more. The files which were in there have been
   moved to either the etc/ or help/ directories (which is where they should
   have been all along)
 - Added the ~L command to the editor.
 - Fixed the ~l command in the editor, it is now possible to do as documented
   and list particular lines in the editor buffer (e.g. ~l25,30 to show lines
   between 25 and 30). As before, ~l25 will show a page of lines starting at
   line 25 and ~l will show the last page of the file.
   ( Given that this was never reported, I wonder how many people know about
     this feature...! )
 - Added the ~p command to the editor as an alias for ~l. This is what some
   people are used to.
 - If the file 'etc/valinfo' exists, it will be emailed to all new users.
   Useful if you want to send a 'newbie' guide.
   (A new user is someone who is setting their email address for the first
    time, or any user created with 'mkuser')
 - Tidied up the hash table routines a little - Changed all of the debug
   messages to a uniform format, rewrote the insert_hash() function.
   Turned on hash debugging for the imud3 hash table - something is amiss
   there and this should help track the problem down.
 - Changed some things in src/imud3.c, have hopefully fixed the imud3 hash
   problems.
 - Wardens will now get error messages too.
 - Added some code to estimate the memory required for a line listing in the
   editor before constructing the pager buffer. This eliminates a lot of calls
   to xrealloc(), so speeding the whole thing up. (This will help even with
   small files).
 - Added a warning message if a user tries to edit a file of over 1000 lines.

1.1.65
 - The angel now records how long the talker was up for at each reboot.
 - The shutdown log also records this information.
 - Changes to replace_interactive(). Fixed the crash bug related to a user
   changing connection (reported by Dreamer) and the more subtle one relating
   to a user changing connection with blocked output (reported by Gamma).
 - The talker will now shut down cleanly in response to an interrupt signal.
   (This means you can now do ^C on the console to cause a clean shutdown)
 - Changes to the ip table functions. If a lookup fails because it is not
   found in the cache, then a request is sent to the erqd. This should stop
   problems of /lost/ ip names when a user is on for a long time while many
   others from different ip's come and go.
 - Several clean-up's ready for 1.2.0

1.1.66
 - Added three new hash table sizes, rewrote i3 hash function.
   (There are getting to be a silly number of hosts on i3..)

1.1.67
 - Added new editor flag 'prompt' to allow users to switch the prompt off.
 - Updated the ew2 alias profile to include more ew2-friendly commands.
 - Better handling of socket errors during tcpsock flushes.
 - Added handling of write errors over intermud-III.

1.1.68
 - Logged talker version in 'idea' and 'sysbug'.
 - Fixed bug in 'force' causing sync loss.
 - Changed the MAX_INET_ADDR define after seeing a 35 character ip name!
