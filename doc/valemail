It is possible to arrange for user's email address to be automatically
validated.

First, you need to enable AUTO_VALEMAIL in the config.h file and pick a
password to secure service port communications.

Now, all you need to do is to arrange for all incoming email to be passed
through a filter such as the example in scripts/valemail.
