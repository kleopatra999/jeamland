The JeamLand feeling system is based on a system developed by Per Persson
(ernakk) for his CD mud feelings soul. The feelings are divided into
categories as follows:

	TYPE		ARGUMENT SYNTAX
	----		---------------
	std		<feeling> [adverb] [user]
	std2		<feeling> <user> [adverb]
	no-arg		<feeling>
	no-targ		<feeling> [adverb]
	targ		<feeling> <user>
	opt-targ	<feeling> [user]

Feelings are all listed in a database file seperated into 'sections'.
Each feeling is listed in three parts:

	feeling name:default post text:default pre text

Although these parts may be used for slightly different things in some
sections.

Some examples:

	agree::with
	boggle:at the concept
	recoil:with fear:from

If a feeling name begins with a '*' character, then the feeling name is not
output, eg:

	*hide:runs and hides
	*ouch:goes Ouch!
	*rofl:rolls around on the floor laughing

The default post and pre texts can contain escapes, these are two-character
sequences which are expanded during feeling execution. All escapes begin
with a # character and the following character determines the expansion;
recognised characters are:

	# - Literal '#'
	' - Literal ':'
	p - actor possessive
	P - target possessive
	o - actor objective
	O - target objective
	r - actor pronoun
	R - target pronoun.
	I - Insert remaining text here.
	n - Newline

Examples:

	bop:#oself on the nose:#i on the nose
	shake:#p head:hands with
	*brighten:thinks about it, then it dawns on #o...#p face brightens
	*hammer:pulls something out from under #p shirt and looks around the room for a victim:runs over to #i and bops #O on the head with an inflatable hammer


The database file itself is formatted as follows:
All lines beginning with a # character are treated as comments.
Sections take the form:

	Section <section_name>
		feeling1
		feeling2
	Endsection
