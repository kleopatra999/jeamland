It would help if you could include exactly what you were doing at the time
of the crash and, if you compiled with the 'CRASH_TRACE' define, the
contents of the lib/backtrace file. If the backtrace contains a line with a
non-nul value in < > brackets, it would help enormously if you could look up
which function this relates to as the numbers in your binary will not match
those in mine.

An example backtrace is:

	VERSION: 0.9w
	OS: Linux 1.2.13 #1 Wed Aug 23 01:06:43 CDT 1995.
	MACHINE: i486.
	Sig: 11
	input_to(wibble) socket.c [748] <0x80163b0>
	process_input(Alcides) socket.c [674] <(nil)>
	process_sockets(phase 5) socket.c [821] <(nil)>
	main() backend.c [454] <(nil)>
	EXECUTION: Input to

In this case, the crash occured during an input_to call to the function
at address 80163b0. To find out which function this is, type:

	nm bin/jeamland | grep 80163b0

The output will look like:

	080163b0 T crash2

In this case, the crash occured in the 'crash2' function.

If possible, a backtrace from a debugger would also be useful.
