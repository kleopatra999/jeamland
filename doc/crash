No bugs are known at the time of release. Should you, however, find any
bugs or strange features, please inform me by emailing
Jeamland@twikki.demon.co.uk

If the talker should crash, it would be very helpful if you could run
the program scripts/mailbug which will send me an email message with
the relevant log extracts which I can use to try and track down the problem.

If possible, a backtrace from a debugger would also be useful.
