JeamLand can run certain system commands at specific times. This is designed
to be used on sites where access to cron proper is not permitted.

To set this up, you will need to define JL_CRON in config.h and then
 simply add the commands you would like to run to the
lib/etc/crontab file in the format:

	hour:min:day of month:day of week,command

Either day of month, day of week or both can be -1 to mean 'all'.

In order to maintain security, the only commands which may be executed
are those which reside in the bin/cron/ directory and the command listed in
lib/etc/crontab will be ignored if it contains any / or . characters.

For more information and help, please feel free to contact:

Or post to alt.talkers.jeamland or alt.talkers.programming.
