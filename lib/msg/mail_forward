Mail Forwarding

It is possible to arrange for every message sent to your JeamLand mailbox
to be copied elsewhere. There are three different types of 'elsewhere'.
NB: The mail is 'copied', not 'forwarded' in the true sense of the word.
To turn /off/ forwarding, type "F-"

1. Another user on the same talker.
	Type:
		F<username>

2. A user on a different talker or mud.
	Type:
		F@<username>@<talker|mud name>

3. A real email address.
	Type:
		F!<username>@<host>
	or:
		F!
	To set it to your current email address.
