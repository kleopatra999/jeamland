				<< Tips >>

::: INTRODUCTION :::

It seems that many of the features of JeamLand are often missed, mainly because
people don't read the help pages for a lot of commands which seem
straightforward. The best way to get the most from the talker, therefore, is
to read all of the help pages! However, the rest of this file lists those
features which I am aware of which are not often found or used.

If you have any suggestions for additions to the following list, please feel
free to contact me on A.Fiddaman@twikki.demon.co.uk or alcides@orchard via
intertalker email.


::: TIPS FOR RESIDENTS :::

 - To return to the entrance room from anywhere, type 'out'.

 - All of the communication commands have abbreviations eg. instead of
	say hello
   you can use
	'hello
   or
	"hello
   If you do not like the default abbreviations, you can use aliases to change
   them.

   Example: To swap the abbreviations for say (') and emote (:) you would use:
	alias \' emote $*
	alias \: say $*
   or even:
	alias \' \\:$*
	alias \: \\'$*
   Don't worry if you don't understand the last two!

 - To create a personal room, type 'home'.

 - To make yourself go to your home room at login, go there and type 'start'

 - To give a command a default argument, see the following example for the
   'last' command.
	alias last $$#0:last \#friends
   This alias will make 'last' act as 'last #friends' and 'last #foo' act as
   'last #foo'

 - To see a history for a particular channel, use '<channel_name> !'

 - On a slow link:
	- You can use the 'brief' command to stop the talker from
	  showing you the room description when you enter it; the 'look'
	  command will still show you the room description.
	- You can turn off autodump mode in the editor to save bandwidth.
	  Just type '~o noautolist' at an editor prompt.
	- You can turn on 'new only' mode in the mailer by typing 'o' at
	  the mailer prompt.

 - If you missed the news message during login, the 'motd' command will
   redisplay it.

 - If your terminal doesn't move down a line after you've typed a command
   type 'nl' to turn on extra newline mode.

 - If you have sent intertalker mail which timed out it will be held in the
   mailqueue. To list your mailqueue, use 'mail -s' and to remove an entry
   from your mailqueue use 'mail -s <entry number>'

 - To execute some commands when you login, you can create a _login alias.
   Similarly _logout. Your _login alias could look like:
	alias _login write;who;write
   The 'write's providing blank lines.

 - You can insert embedded newlines into any input. Do to this, just end
   a line with a single \ character and continue typing on the next line.
   Example:
	> say Hello\
	everyone
   yields
	You say 'Hello
		Everyone'


::: TIPS FOR ADMINISTRATORS :::

 - To log in with your sly login flag set, prefix your name with a - character
   at the login prompt.

 - To execute commands as root, you can use the 'sudo' command. The sudo
   command access rights are contained in the file etc/sudoers. Using sudo
   should make it unecessary to ever log in as root other than to reset an
   administrator's password. (sudo chpasswd will fail as it is a multi-part
   command.)

 - The lock command can be used with an argument to lock a room to members of
   a system grupe; to remove a lock of this type use 'unlock grupe'

 - Root can kill any event by using 'kill #event_id'

 - Root can view and remove any member of the mailqueue.

 - The 'log' command by itself lists available log files or, with an argument,
   shows the last 20 lines or so of the log.

 - You can set or break snoops using 'snoop force' and 'snoop break'.

 - The chlev command can be used with either numeric or text level values.
   Example:
	chlev test warden
   is equivalent to:
	chlev test 3
