NAME		chemail
SYNTAX		chemail <user> <address>
		chemail -r <user>
DESCRIPTION	Change <user>'s email address to <address>.
		The second form (remove) allows you to have a user who
		has no email address. If you don't set it like this, then
		the user will not be able to save to disk, and if he/she sets
		a dummy email address, then the validation will fail and the
		user will be deleted.
