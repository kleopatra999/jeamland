NAME		siteban
SYNTAX		siteban
		siteban <wildcard host>
		siteban !<wildcard host>
		siteban <host>[/netmask] [level]
		siteban !<host>[/netmask]
		siteban -r [!]<host>[/netmask]
		siteban -v <entry number>
DESCRIPTION	The siteban command is used to ban logins from certain sites.
		There are currently three 'levels' of banishment:
		    Ban all:           1
		    Ban all but admin: 2
		    Ban all new users: 3
		with 'Ban all' being the default.

		All addresses must be specified as ip numbers
		    i.e. aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd

		Some elements may be the character '*' in order to ban a
		particular subnet, for example:
		    123.124.*.*

		Prefixing an address with a ! makes it an exclusion rule.
		    i.e. logins ARE allowed from this host.

		Using the argument of -r will remove a rule from the siteban
		table.

		Using the argument of -v will show full information for the
		siteban rule including the message shown to attempted logins.

		Siteban without arguments will list the current rules.


		For advanced users:

		All addresses may be followed by an optional netmask in either
		dot form (as above) or as a subnet specifier
		    i.e. number between 0 and 32
		This gives more precise control over banishment.


EXAMPLE	
		To disallow logins from 123.124.125.126

		To disallow logins from the hosts with ip numbers matching
		123.124.xxx.xxx

			siteban 123.124.*.*

		or, in advanced form:
			siteban 123.124.0.0/16
		or
			siteban 123.124.0.0/255.255.0.0

		To disallow all logins other than those from hosts with ip
		numbers matching 129.11.xxx.xxx

			siteban *
			siteban !129.11.*.*

		or, in advanced form:
			siteban 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0
			siteban !129.11.0.0/255.255.0.0
		or
