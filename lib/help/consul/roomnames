This is not a command, only information.

The code in Jeamland is set up to class rooms as one of three types, these
types being as follows:

USER ROOMS
	These are rooms starting with one of the letters a-z. To change one
	of these rooms, you must either own it or be of a level greater
	than a warden and also greater than that of the rooms owner.
	Only root can change user rooms owned by overseers.
	If a user is granted more than one room, the names of the 'extra'
	rooms should be <username>#1, <username>#2 etc. to prevent
	confusion and to enable the 'myrooms' command to work correctly.

SYSTEM ROOMS
	These are rooms starting with a _ character. To change one of these
	rooms, you must either own it, of be of a level greater than a
	warden. No further checking is performed.

ROOT OWNED SYSTEM ROOMS
	Only root can change these rooms.
