DESCRIPTION	Handle boards in rooms.
		Options are as follows:

	    -add	Add a board to the current room.
	    -remove	Remove a board from the current room.
	    -read	Restrict read access to a particular grupe.
	    -write	Restrict write access to a particular grupe.
	    -archive	Set an archive board to which any notes falling off
			the top of this board will be added. You should
			probably disallow write access to the archive board.
	    -followup	Set a board to which any followup notes are to be
			redirected.
	    -reload	Reload the board from disk. One use of this is to
			wipe all of the poster's names from a board after
			making it anonymous. It is also useful if you have
			edited the board from outside the talker and need to
			update the loaded copy.
	    -anon	Marks a board as anonymous. All poster's names are
			stored as 'someone'. This option is a toggle.
