			Frequently Asked Questions
			--------------------------

Q.	Why doesn't my alias work ?
A.	There could be two reasons. One common mistake is to omit the $*
	expression at the end of the alias as in:
		alias t tell $*
	The other possibility is that your alias contains some reserved
	characters. The reserved characters are: $, @, &, #, % and ; which
	must be escaped by prefixing them with a \ character.

Q.	Why is this FAQ so short ?
A.	Because nobody has asked anything ;-)
