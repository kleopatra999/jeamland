DESRIPTION	This command handles your signature file. Your signature is
		a small portion of text which is appended to either a mail
		or board message which you post. 'sig' by itself shows your
		current signature and your current signature use settings.
		'sig -mail' and 'sig -board' are both toggles and turn on/off
		whether signatures are appended to mail/board messages.
		Signatures are limited to four lines of 70 characters on
		each. In order to enforce this, automatic linewrap will be
		used in the editor regardless of your current option setting.
