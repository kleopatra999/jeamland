DESCRIPTION	The attr command allows you to set the colour in which certain
		talker messages appear on your screen. To see the list of
		available attributes, and their current settings, just type
		'attr'.
		To reset all colour attributes to their default values, use
			'attr -default'
		To remove all colour attributes use 'attr -wipe'

		To set a colour attribute to be applied to all public messages
		generated by a particular user or users who are members of a
		grupe, use the 'attr -user' form of the command.
EXAMPLES
		attr -user flibble ~m
			Will make everything said, emoted etc. in the
			current room by flibble to appear in flashing magenta.
		attr -user flibble
			will cancel this behaviour.
		attr -user -wipe
			will remove all user attributes.

		attr -user #consul+ ~r
			Will make everything said, emoted etc. in the
			current room by a user whose level is consul or
			greater, to appear in flashing red.

		As a special case:
		attr -user -default ~m
			Will make everything said by all users who are not
			specifically listed in your other user attributes to
			appear in flashing magenta.

		followed by one or more colour modifier, as follows:
