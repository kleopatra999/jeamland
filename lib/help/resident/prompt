NAME		prompt
SYNTAX		prompt [string]
		prompt -iaceor
		prompt -iacga
DESCRIPTION	Sets your prompt to [string].
		To include a space at the end of the prompt, escape it with
		a \. eg. 'prompt Jeamland>\ '
		[string] can include cookies and escape codes.

		Prompt without arguments lists your current settings.

		The last two forms of the command are used to toggle prompt
		compatibility modes used with common telnet clients.
		TUsh uses the 'iaceor' method, tf can use either.
		The best approach is probably to experiment.

EXAMPLES	'prompt [%t] %n\% (%!)\ '
		or with colour,
		'prompt %cc.[%t] %n\% (%!) %cz'
		and, for status line freaks....
		'prompt %i[%t] %N %r%b%n\% (%!)\ '
