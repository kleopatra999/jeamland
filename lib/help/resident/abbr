NAME		abbr
SYNTAX		abbr <character> [command]
DESCRIPTION	Abbr adds, removes or redefines a system command shortcut.
		For example, by default, the ';' prefix executes the 'memote'
		command. If you are used to using ';' for 'emote' then you
		need only issue the command:
			abbr ; emote
		To remove this mapping, you would use:
			abbr ;
NOTA BENE	abbr is actually a global alias wrapper to the 'alias' command
		and may have been removed by the administrators.
SEE ALSO	alias
