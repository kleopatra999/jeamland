DESCRIPTION	Grupe is the grupe administration command.
		A Grupe is basically a list of people who can be referred to
		by just one name; there are three types of grupe:
		 1. User grupes.
			User grupes are grupes which contain all users of a
			specific level or level set, examples of these are
			warden, warden+, warden-, consul.
			The warden+ grupe contains all users who are level
			'warden' or above. Similarly, warden- contans all users
			who are level 'warden' or below.
			NB: Due to the internal storage of levels, it is not
			    possible to identify users who are below 'citizen'
			    level and therefore the 'resident' grupe does not
			    exist.
		 2. System grupes.
			Grupes which are global, listed and amended by using
			the grupe command with a capital G.
		 3. Personal grupes.
			Grupes which are personal to each user. Each user can
			have up to 10 groups of 15 members each. (Your local
			administrator may have changed these limits)

		A grupe may contain an exclusion element which is a name
		prefixed by a ! character.
		eg:
			#consul+,!root
		is the grupe containing all users of level consul or above
		but excluding root.

		The finger command may be used to list the contents of a grupe.
		Grupes are currently useable in 'tell' and 'mail' commands.
		(Open to suggestions ;-)
