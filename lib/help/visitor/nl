NAME		nl
SYNTAX		nl
DESCRIPTION	Some telnet clients in local echo mode only interpret a
		depression of the 'return' or 'enter' key as a carriage
		return, not a new line. This results in the cursor being
		returned to the start of the current line without moving
		downwards first. The nl command toggles extra newlines
		to compensate for this - try it, you might like it *;0)
