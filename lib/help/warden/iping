NAME		iping
SYNTAX		iping <host>
		iping [%]<host ip> <udp port>
DESCRIPTION	Send a ping request to <host>.
		The second form is only useable by Administrators and sends
		a generic ping packet directly to a particular host and port.
		The default is to send an inetd ping, but prefixing the ip
		number with a % character sends a cdudp ping.
