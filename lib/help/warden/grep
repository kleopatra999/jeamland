NAME		grep
SYNTAX		grep [-i] <substring> <filename>
DESCRIPTION	A very simple implementation of the unix 'grep' command.
		With this command, you can search a file in the library for
		a particular one word substring. Prefixing the substring with
		the -i option will cause the command to ignore differences in
		case when searching.
		The command will prefix each line found with the line number
                in [ ].
