NAME		watch
SYNTAX		see below
DESCRIPTION	The watch command allows you to keep track of a number of files
		in the talker lib.

		The watch options are as follows (the - is optional):

		watch			List watched files with changes.
		watch -n		 "     "      "     "    "
		watch -c		Catchup on watched files.
		watch -l		List files you are watching.
		watch -s <file|dir>	Start watching a file or directory.
		watch -S <dir>		Start watching all files in a directory.
		watch -u <file|dir>	Stop watching a file or directory.
		watch -U <prefix>	Stop watching all files beginning with
					<prefix>. Wildcards are not supported,
					but using -U with an argument of "*"
					will remove all watched boards.

NOTA BENE	If you watch a directory, then you will be informed only that
		something has changed about it. This change could be that a
		file within that directory has changed, or that the directory
		permissions etc. have been altered.

THANKS		To Ernakk (Per Persson) for the "watch" concept which I have
		shamefully borrowed.
