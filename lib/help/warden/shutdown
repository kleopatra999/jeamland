NAME		shutdown
SYNTAX		shutdown <now> 
		shutdown <abort>
		shutdown <delay> [message]
		shutdown <nokick>
DESCRIPTION	Shutdown the server.
		If a delay is specified without a message, a default will
		be used; the default is:
			Presumably for a good reason ;-)
		Wardens must provide a reason.

		The nokick option toggles your nokick flag. If this is not set,
		you will be kicked off the talker as soon as the final shutdown
		sequence commences; otherwise, you will remain connected until
		the talker process exits.
