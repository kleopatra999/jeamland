NAME		hash
SYNTAX		hash [-t] [table]
DESCRIPTION	Shows statistics relating to the internal hash tables.
		By default, the hash command will list summary information
		on all hash tables. With the -t option, the output will also
		include a schema dump of the tables.
		You can restrict the output to one table only by providing the
		table name as an argument; the tables available are:
			command, feeling, alias and jlm
NB		Not all tables may be listed as their existance is a compile
		time option.
