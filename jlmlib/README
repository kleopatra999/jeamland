This directory contains the library which is designed to be linked to jlm's
in order for them to be able to communicate with the talker.

Just type "make" for compile options.

You may need to edit the Makefile to specify your compiler and warning
options.

Look at the mirror.c file for a simple example jlm.

---

You don't have to use these libraries; in fact, you don't need to write a
jlm in C.

The protocol for communicating with the talker is as follows:


	#!service_name		Start of service packet
				Valid services are:
					ident	Identify myself.
					claim	Claim command.
					func	Call function.
	#!			End of service packet.
	#!(arg)			Service argument packet.

So, if your program wants to send a message to a particular user, it need only
send the following to its standard output:

	#!func
	#!(write_user)
	#!(user_name)
	Hello there!
	#!

Of course, if you're writing the jlm in C, and are linking with the library in
this directory, then you need only do:

	write_user(user_name, "Hello there!");


More explanation is beyond the scope of this document, but look at the files
mirror.c, calc.c and doom.c for examples.
