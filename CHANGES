1.0.1
 - Fixed bug in the editor where listing a file containing a line longer than
   1024 characters would cause general memory corruption. Also added a check
   to sadd_strbuf() to pick up any similar problems.
 - Fixed bug in the epost command. exiting with an empty buffer or with the
   ~q command caused a crash.

1.0.2
 - Fixed bug in the editor.. Executing a search and replace with a null
   search string caused a crash.
